# OrevaApp – STON.fi Grant Integration (Placeholder Repo)

This repository serves as a placeholder for our STON.fi grant application.

## 🔒 Why This Is a Placeholder

OrevaApp is currently under active development by our full-stack TON developer and smart contract engineer. Due to the private nature of our contracts and in-app logic at the MVP stage, the full codebase is not public yet.

## 🛠️ What This Grant Will Enable

- Seamless integration of STON.fi swap and liquidity features inside OrevaApp  
- Core trading pairs like OREVA/TON, OREVAPUP/TON, PENGU/TON, OREVAPUP/OREVA, PENGU/OREVA etc powered by STON.fi  
- In-app trading powered by STON.fi, alongside native staking and NFT utility within OrevaApp  
- Liquidity deployment and live trading aligned with our TGE (Token Generation Event)

## 🧩 Project Overview

OrevaApp is a gamified DeFi utility hub built on TON, designed to bring real use cases to Telegram users. With NFTs, governance, mining, memecoins, and gamified rewards all under one interface, OrevaApp is creating a Web3 super-app optimized for user experience and community growth.

STON.fi will serve as our primary liquidity layer and trading infrastructure, even as we scale toward CEX partnerships and wider adoption.
